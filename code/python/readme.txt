Observations:
- The Python codes are organised into five folders: 
    - A_extraction_landscape_attributes: Extraction and aggregation of the landscape attributes. 
    - B_extraction_meteorological_records: Extraction and aggregation of meteorological records. 
    - C_computation_signatures_and_indices: Hydro-meteorological and streamflow signatures computation. 
    - D_demonstration_streamflow_data: Download instructions for the streamflow catalogue and some demonstrations. 
    - E_complementary_extra_codes: Complementary scripts that might be used for additional analysis by users. 
- The scripts contained in C_computation_signatures_and_indices depend on the previous run of B_extraction_meteorological_records. All the other scripts are independent.  
- Before the Python aggregation codes, one should run first the gee scripts in Google Earth Engine platform and store the results locally.
- If the GitHub was cloned locally and the requirements are fulfilled, the users can expect to do not experience problems to run the scripts. 
- The scripts are well commented and give further guidance for the reproducibility of the work. 
- Users should download and place the 'chromedriver.exe' inside the 'D_demonstration_streamflow_data' directory for a proper use of the 'selenium' python module.
